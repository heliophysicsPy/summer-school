    "# Motivation for the HAPI Standard\n",
    "\n",
    "The Heliophysics Application Programmer's Interface (HAPI) specification allows data providers to use a standard set of conventions for returning data in response to a URL-based request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This specification was developed because no standard exists. Data providers use incompatible conventions so that automated access to and aggregation of data requires users to write custom code to read data for each data provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, prior to HAPI, to write a Python program that downloads data using the web API from SSCWeb, CDAWeb, LISIRD, and AMDA would require writing four scripts that implements each of their APIs.\n",

    "The HAPI project has two parts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Developement of [the API standard](https://github.com/hapi-server/data-specification)\n",
    "2. Development of [software that implements the standard](http://github.com/hapi-server/) (server-side software for data providers and client-side software for scientists)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will learn to use the Python HAPI client, [`hapiclient`](https://github.com/hapi-server/client-python), and the plotting tool [`hapiplot`](https://github.com/hapi-server/plot-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "`hapiclient` is required for all activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "`hapiplot` is a software package that was developed for testing and quick-look plots of data returned by `hapiclient`. \n",

    "# Finding Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As will be demonstrated, if you know what dataset and parameter you want, a few lines of Python (or IDL, MATLAB, etc.) is all that is needed to get data into your program in a form that is ready for analysis and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HAPI project and HAPI standard addresses the \"**access**\" problem. That is, it makes accessing and reading data using software easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the HAPI project does not address the \"**discovery**\" problem. That is, it does not address making discovering what data are available given a search term. \n",
    "\n",
    "The page [https://hapi-server.org/servers](http://hapi-server.org/servers) contains a complete list of all HAPI servers and their datasets and parameters. It does not contain a global search (or discovery) interface, however. This interface may be useful if you have a general idea of what you are looking for (e.g., Solar Irradiance data from LASP/LISIRD).\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Heliophysics Data Portal (HDP)](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/) can be used for more general searches and discovery. For example, a search for 'dst' data and 'hapi' (as keywords entered in the \"Text Restriction\" box) for the time range of Nov-Dec 2021 yields 33 entries: 8 for Cluster, 24 for MMS, and 1 for OMNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, not all data available from HAPI servers is available for search at the [Heliophysics Data Portal (HDP)](https://heliophysicsdata.gsfc.nasa.gov/). There is an on-going effort to make all HAPI data searchable from this interface."
